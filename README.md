## Hey there!

### I'm Vasilis!

Your usual Pikachu (And now Avali as of recently) on the internet!

I'm a young self-taught programmer who loves to work on video games and useful tools for communities.

I consider myself genderfluid and use **any** pronouns

When I'm not coding, I like playing VR, games in general, or trying to learn to draw.

Currently teaching myself C# and Python
